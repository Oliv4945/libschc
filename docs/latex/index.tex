libschc is a C implementation of the Static Context Header Compression, drafted by the I\+E\+TF. It is a header compression technique, used in Low Power Wide Area Networks in order to enable tiny low-\/power microcontrollers to have an end-\/to-\/end I\+Pv6 connection. This repository contains both the compression aswell as the fragmentation mechanism. For further information related to S\+C\+HC, see \href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc/}{\texttt{ https\+://datatracker.\+ietf.\+org/doc/draft-\/ietf-\/lpwan-\/ipv6-\/static-\/context-\/hc/}}.

See the \href{/docs}{\texttt{ docs}} for more information on the implemenation and configuration.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{L\+I\+M\+I\+T\+A\+T\+I\+O\+NS}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
As this implementation is work in progress, there are some limitations you should keep in mind.

The library has been designed in such a way that it can be used on top of a constrained device, as well as on a more powerful server side device. As a consequence, memory allocation and memory intensive calculations are avoided. Fixed point arithmetic is used for 8-\/bit mircoprocessors, however some optimizations are possible. Consequently, the rules are constructed of 8-\/bit arrays, availble on all devices.

The current implementation is based on draft-\/ietf-\/lpwan-\/ipv6-\/static-\/context-\/hc-\/18 (\href{https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc/18/}{\texttt{ https\+://datatracker.\+ietf.\+org/doc/draft-\/ietf-\/lpwan-\/ipv6-\/static-\/context-\/hc/18/}}), some naming conventions are therefore not in line with the current specification.

Please keep in mind that the library works, but is still very experimental!\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{E\+X\+A\+M\+P\+L\+ES}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
In the folder examples are both basic compression and fragmentation examples provided. The fragmentation example makes use of a timer library and should be adapted to your platform (see \href{/docs/fragmentation}{\texttt{ Fragmentation}} and the examples folder).\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysection{L\+I\+C\+E\+N\+SE}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
