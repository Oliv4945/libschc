Static Context Header Compression is a header compression technique, 
used in LPWAN's in order to enable tiny low-power microcontrollers
to have an end-to-end IPv6 connection.

This repository contains both the compression aswell as the
fragmentation mechanism.

More information will follow soon.

The library depends on two other libraries:
- picocoap, which is used to parse and unparse the CoAP header
- jsmn, used to parse json, as used in the rules
