ABOUT LIBSCHC
=============

libschc is a C implementation of the Static Context Header Compression, drafted by the IETF.
It is a header compression technique, used in Low Power Wide Area Networks in order to enable 
tiny low-power microcontrollers to have an end-to-end IPv6 connection. 
This repository contains both the compression aswell as the fragmentation mechanism.
For further information related to SCHC, see <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-lpwan-ipv6-static-context-hc/>.
